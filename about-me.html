                <p>My name is Cameron Resuta. HealthCare Worker/Personal Trainer turned Software Developer.
                    Originally from Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, I moved out to the Columbus area in May of 2019 
                    to pursue a career as a new, NASM-certified Personal Trainer. Having a background in Exercise
                    Physiology from West Virginia University, I was set on starting a long-term career that allowed me to 
                    further my knowledge and skills I had acquired after graduation. As time went by, I continued to
                    fall back to a constant passion and love of mine, technology. Using it as a well-equipped tool to help solve problems
                    through various processes was always something that appealed to me. I credit my first job in Columbus, as an 
                    eCommerce Associate, working alongside a Web Developer who first introduced me to programming, that ultimately led me to where I am at now. 
                    I took the unconventional path to get here, but I finally feel that I am exactly where I've wanted to be.

            <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                Hello! My name is Cameron and I am originally from Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. In 2019, two years
                after I graduated with a degree in Exercise Physiology, I moved out to Columbus, Ohio to pursue a 
                career in fitness as a personal trainer. About a month after moving I was fortunate enough to find a job, 
                but it was not in the exercise/fitness industry as a Personal Trainer. My new job was that of an eCommerce associate,
                helping the day-to-day operations of our company's WooCommerce and Amazon.com storefront's through data/cost analysis, product
                research, and inventory control management (just to name a few). At this new job, I worked with a full-stack web developer in 
                our eCommerce department who had introduced me to programming. I was first apprehensive at the whole thing and thought to myself, 
                "There's no way I could see myself getting into this. Yea, I've always loved technology and everything about it, but this just looked like 
                something that was way too advanced for me". Boy, did my opinion change! I instantly fell in love with it. 
                I found myself studying every night after work and practicing what I learned on the weekends. The idea of communicating with 
                your machine and giving it specific instructions that would then be displayed in front of you was extremely fascinating to me. Fast
                forward to today, and I'm currently enrolled in a Full-Stack Java Bootcamp, pursuing a career in Tech that I never thought I would 
                ever do. My passion for coding continues to grow every day and I'm excited for what the future may hold!
