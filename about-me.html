                <p>My name is Cameron Resuta. HealthCare Worker/Personal Trainer turned Software Developer.
                    Originally from Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, I moved out to the Columbus area in May of 2019 
                    to pursue a career as a new, NASM-certified Personal Trainer. Having a background in Exercise
                    Physiology from West Virginia University, I was set on starting a long-term career that allowed me to 
                    further my knowledge and skills I had acquired after graduation. As time went by, I continued to
                    fall back to a constant passion and love of mine, technology. Using it as a well-equipped tool to help solve problems
                    through various processes was always something that appealed to me. I credit my first job in Columbus, as an 
                    eCommerce Associate, working alongside a Web Developer who first introduced me to programming, that ultimately led me to where I am at now. 
                    I took the unconventional path to get here, but I finally feel that I am exactly where I've wanted to be.
