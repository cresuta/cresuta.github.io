                <p>Welcome! My name is Cameron and I am originally from Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. My story of when I decided
                    to pursue a career in software development didn't start until after I graduated college. Two years
                    after I graduated with a degree in Exercise Physiology, I moved out to Columbus, Ohio to pursue a 
                    career in fitness as a personal trainer. I ended up finding a job a month after I moved, but it had nothing to do with
                    what I went to school for. At this job, I worked with a web developer in our eCommerce department who had 
                    introduced me to programming. I was first apprehensive at the whole thing and thought to myself, "There's no way I could
                    see myself getting into this, it looks way too difficult for me". Boy, was I wrong! I instantly fell in love with it. 
                    I found myself studying every night after work and practicing what I learned on the weekends. The idea of communicating with 
                    your machine and giving it specific instructions that would then be displayed in front of you was unbelievable to me. Fast
                    forward to today, and I'm currently enrolled in a Full-Stack Java Bootcamp, pursuing a career in Tech. My 
                    passion for coding continues to grow every day and I'm excited for what the future holds!
